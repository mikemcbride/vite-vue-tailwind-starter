# Vite with Vue and Tailwind

This is a template repo to quickly scaffold an app with Vue 3 and Tailwind for prototyping.

## What You Get

By using this template, you've got a full featured setup ready to go for building apps. You get:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the dev server
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) for the app framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [Vue Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/vue-testing-library/intro) for testing

It comes with a `<Counter>` component that has increment/decrement buttons to update a "count" value. This component has tests built out so you have a reference for how to set up future tests.

`<MyComponent>` file exists but it just displays some text - "Let's get started". This is the file you'll use for prototyping. Rename as you see fit.
